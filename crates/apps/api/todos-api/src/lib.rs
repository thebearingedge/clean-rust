//! The todos HTTP API, packaged as a lib with a thin `main` bin on top.
//!
//! - [`api`] builds the axum [`Router`](axum::Router) and the aide-generated
//!   `OpenAPI` document served at `/openapi.json`
//! - [`controller`] defines the HTTP DTOs and the request handlers
//! - [`app_state`] bundles the domain interactors and the request-validation
//!   schema validators the handlers share
//!
//! Domain errors are mapped to HTTP responses at this boundary in
//! `app_error.rs` (private) rather than inside the `web` lib.
