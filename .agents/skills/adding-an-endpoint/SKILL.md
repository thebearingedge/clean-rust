description: Adding a new HTTP endpoint to any API app in the clean-rust workspace (e.g. `todos-api`). Use when implementing a new route or handler — covers the domain-first workflow, DTO naming, schema validation wiring, OpenAPI descriptions, error mapping, migrations, and the per-handler test layout.

# Adding an HTTP endpoint in clean-rust

Read `AGENTS.md` at the repo root first, then the `writing-rust` skill (naming, layering, error patterns, verification loop). This skill is the endpoint-specific playbook for **any** API app — substitute your `<domain>` and `<app>` for `todos`/`todos-api` throughout.

Work **inside-out**: domain → infrastructure → delivery → tests. Each step is a natural task boundary; the `writing-rust` dependency direction holds at every step.

## 1. Domain — the use case and its port

- Define/extend the use case in `crates/domains/<domain>/src/use_cases` and, if the use case needs persistence, its repository port using the file-and-folder pattern (module layout: see `writing-rust`). The port speaks in domain models and returns `Result<_, <Thing>Error>`-style domain errors — no delivery types (leak list: `writing-rust`).
- Add/extend model types in `crates/domains/<domain>/src/models`, named `*Model` (e.g. `<Thing>Model`, `New<Thing>Model`, `<Thing>UpdateModel`). Put invariants on the model (e.g. `has_valid_task`) — validation has one source of truth (see `writing-rust`).
- Extend the domain error (`use_cases/<thing>_error.rs`, thiserror) with any new variant. New error variants need an HTTP mapping later — plan for it.
- Document every public item as you go (doc lint: `writing-rust`); business rules and their tests live here.

## 2. Infrastructure — implement the port

- Implement the port in `crates/domains/<domain>/src/infrastructure` with sqlx + sea-query. Repository errors go in a dedicated `<thing>_error.rs` file — classify and wrap the sqlx error (see `writing-rust` for `{source}` interpolation).
- If the schema changes, add a migration under `crates/domains/<domain>/migrations`: `just migrate <domain> add` to create, `just migrate <domain> run` to apply (`just migrate <domain> revert` to undo, `revert --target-version 0` to revert all — syntax lives in the `AGENTS.md` commands table; schema patterns and SQL formatting live in the `writing-sql` skill).
- Dependency direction check: infrastructure may depend on the domain's use_cases (to see the port), never the reverse.

## 3. Delivery — the app layer

In `crates/apps/<app>/src`, working through four files:

### controller.rs — handler + DTOs

- Name the DTOs after the domain models: `<Thing>Model` → `<Thing>Http` (no other morphemes — `<Thing>PutHttp` would be wrong; the verb lives in the route). Query structs end in `Query` (`List<Domain>Query`); add a path struct when the route has path params (`<Thing>Path`).
- Colocate each HTTP struct immediately above the handler that uses it, not grouped at the top of the file.
- Doc-comment the handler and **every** DTO type and field: via schemars, the doc comments become the OpenAPI schema and parameter descriptions (doc lint: `writing-rust`). Field docs should state units, defaults, bounds, and nullability semantics.
- Validate request bodies through the app's schema validators: use `ValidatedJson<T>` / `ValidatedQuery<T>` / `ValidatedPath<T>` from `web` (they enforce JSON-schema rules derived from the DTO via `HasSchema`, configured in `AppState`). Rejections surface as the documented 422 `ValidationErrorBody`.
- Handlers return `Result<impl IntoResponse, AppError>` and carry `# Errors` doc sections.

### app_state.rs — register the validator

- `AppState` pairs the interactors with a `Validator` per request DTO (`HasSchema`). Register the new DTO there. (`# Panics` doc applies — `AppState::new` derives schemas eagerly.)

### app_error.rs — map the new errors

- Add `From<YourDomainError>`-level mappings so the new domain error variants produce the right status codes — this file is the only place domain → HTTP mapping happens (leak list: `writing-rust`). The app's `ApiError` is deliberately not a thiserror type — follow that.
- Add inline `#[cfg(test)]` unit tests for each new mapping (e.g. `not_found_maps_to_404`) in this file.

### api.rs — route + OpenAPI metadata

- Mount the route with `ApiRouter` and a transform closure. Set `op.id(...)` (camelCase `operationId`, e.g. `listThings`), `.summary(...)`, and **`.description(...)` — aide cannot read handler doc comments**, so the operation description is a deliberate duplicate of the handler's doc-comment first paragraph; keep the two in sync (the file carries a keep-in-sync note).
- Chain the response types (`.response::<code, Json<T>>`) and the shared `standard_get_errors`/`standard_post_errors`/`standard_put_errors` transforms for the documented error responses.
- The OpenAPI document is generated at runtime by aide and served at `GET /openapi.json` — there is no committed `openapi.json` file. Success-response descriptions come from the response DTO's doc comment; if a response shows `description: ""`, the DTO is missing its doc comment.

## 4. Tests

- **Integration tests**: one file per handler — `tests/<handler_snake_case>.rs` (e.g. `add_thing.rs`). Cross-cutting tests (OpenAPI document checks, infrastructure-failure scenarios like the 503) go in `tests/api.rs`. Every test file has a crate-level `//!` doc (doc lint: `writing-rust`) and starts with `mod common;`.
- **Seed with fixtures, not chained endpoints**: create a `tests/fixtures/<operation_id_snake_case>.sql` file (e.g. `updateThing` → `update_thing.sql`) with plain INSERTs and load it via `#[sqlx::test(migrator = "<domain>::MIGRATOR", fixtures("<name>"))]`. Assert deltas against the fixture's known values. `#[sqlx::test]` gives each test an isolated database — no truncate helpers needed.
- **Use the shared helpers**: generic request helpers (`get`, `post_json`, `put_json`, `post_body`, `next_cursor`, `ResponseParts`) live in `web::test_support` (apps opt in via `web = { workspace = true, features = ["test-support"] }`) — import them **directly in each test file, only what that file uses**. App-specific shared helpers live in `tests/common.rs` (flat file, included via `mod common;`); keep it to helpers *every* test binary uses — endpoint-specific helpers (fixture id derivation, response decoders like `read_page`) go in the single test file that uses them. Never duplicate the generic helpers locally, and never add `#![allow(dead_code, unused_imports)]` to test modules — structure the imports instead.
- Cover at least: the happy path, validation rejections (missing/invalid body, 422), not-found paths (404), malformed parameters, and — for new error mappings — each status the app_error tests assert. Match the existing assertion stack: `claims::assert_ok!`, `serde_json_assert::assert_json_include!`, content-type checks alongside status checks.
- If the endpoint adds schemas/operations worth pinning, extend the OpenAPI tests in `tests/api.rs` (`documents_descriptions_across_the_spec` is the pattern).

## 5. Verify the whole path

Run the `writing-rust` verify loop from the repo root, with compose services up (`just infrastructure up -d --wait`).
